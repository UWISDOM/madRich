\title{Create word cloud plots to help in annotation of gene set clusters}
\usage{
clusterWordclouds(cluster_result = NULL, rmwords = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluster_result}{the result of clusterSets which contains the overlap coefficient distance matrix and the cluster membership of gene sets to be plotted}

\item{rmwords}{a vector of words to remove from wordclouds. a standard list of words is included (articles, common broad category names, etc), but if your results have unexpected emphasis of useless words, you can add more here.}
}
\value{
a list of ggplot objects
}
